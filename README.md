## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://i.imgur.com/2STA5KO.png)

After making a discord bot in Java, I wanted to create a more simple bot in python, with the main goals of having an XP system and  music system.

What I learned from this project:

* Developing my skills with Python
* Working with full stack, from design and front end to back end
* Using API's (dismusic, discord.py)
* Learning optimization techniques for performance
* Running a always-on service (server hosting)

## Features

Here is a full list of commands this bot currently supports

* ?Play, plays a song from url.
* ?pause, pauses the current song.
* ?disconnect, disconnects the bot from the voice channel.
* ?connect, connects the bot to the voice channel.
* ?rank, displays the rank of the user who uses the command.

More commands are on the way as this project is still a work in progress!
